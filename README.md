Patintero is derived from the Spanish word tinta ("tint" or "ink") in reference to the drawn lines. Another name for it is tubigan, tubiganay, or tubig-tubig ("water [game]"), due to the fact that the grid lines are also commonly drawn by wetting the ground with water. It is also known as harangang-taga or harang-taga (lit. "block and catch"), referring to the game mechanics.[2][3]

Other names for the game include lumplumpas (Igorot), alagwa (Kapampangan), sinibon or serbab (Ilokano), and tadlas (for four players) or birus-birus (for six players) in eastern Visayas.[3]
